Functionality:
The app reads data from 3 different types of files, they are formatted as follows:
.prj files:
  (Name of the project)
  (name of the .tl file for the timeline)
  (name of the .bgt file for the budget)
.tl files with any amount of lines
  name of the timeline event,the due date of the event,t/f of if this objective has been completed
.bgt files with any amount of lines
  name of cost, price of cost

after collecting the data the user will be able to browse and view the data from any project, sepereated by a timeline page, budget page, and main page for each project
the functionality we did not have time for due to team disorganization and lack of participation from groupmates
is the ability to write back to the app and have the data saved in the files.

The code does not support the creation of files by the due date. Any files in the code will be handled properly, and the app is capable of updating the displayed data if the files change there is just no way for the user to create a file without adding it to the assets folder manually. The 2 examples I wrote project files for is the "Application programming Project" and "Gamejam" the middle 2 options route their data back to application programming project because Writting 4 examples was un needed for the presentation, but if those file were fully written it would work as expected.

How to Run:
to clone this project simply take both the "app" and "graddle scripts" folders and move them into a andrio studio project. (Same way you would grade the labs)
an apk file has also been provided for those with a functional emulator, however the apk is unsigned so certain emulators that rely on signatures will not function.
The emulator built into andriod studio functions perfectly
