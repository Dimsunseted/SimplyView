Functionality:
The app reads data from 3 different types of files, they are formatted as follows:
.prj files:
  (Name of the project)
  (name of the .tl file for the timeline)
  (name of the .bgt file for the budget)
.tl files with any amount of lines
  name of the timeline event,the due date of the event,t/f of if this objective has been completed
.bgt files with any amount of lines
  name of cost, price of cost

after collecting the data the user will be able to browse and view the data from any project, sepereated by a timeline page, budget page, and main page for each project
the functionality we did not have time for due to team disorganization and lack of participation from groupmates
is the ability to write back to the app and have the data saved in the files.
